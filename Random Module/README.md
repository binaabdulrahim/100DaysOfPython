 Module is responsible for a different bit of functionality of your program. 

 Random module was created by python to make it easier for us to generate our random numbers without needing to get into complexities of all of the math that is required to generate pseudorandom. 

 How can we create our own module?
    Main.py is entry point to our program 
    Create another file and name it. 
    You can import that file into main.py module.
