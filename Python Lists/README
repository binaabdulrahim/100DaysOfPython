Python List:  is a data structure - its a way of organizing and storing data in Python
How do you store a group piece of data --> data that has a connection with each other like all the states in US
Also, data that has order just a people in queue

Lists would like this fruits = ["item1", "item2"] and you can = print(fruits [0]) and inside the bracket if you add -1 than the list will start counting from end of the list
