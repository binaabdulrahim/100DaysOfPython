Python List is a data structure - its a way of organizing and storing data in Python
How do you store a group piece of data --> data that has a connection with each other like all the states in US
Also, data that has order just a people in queue.

Lists would look like this: 
  fruits = ["item1", "item2"]
  
You can print by: 
  print(fruits [0]) 

Fun fact: Inside the square bracket, if you put -1 than the list will start counting from end of the list!
